This tool contains many utilities that aid in OS development.

[Syntax]
devtoolkit <orderType> [arguments/switches]

[Orders types]
Here are the possible orders you can use:

burn <input>: Writes <input> file into another file, with configurable offsets
  and length.
  -to <path>: Destination file
  -srcOff <number>: Offset into the source file. By default is 0.
    Anything behind the source offset will be ignored.
  -dstOff <number>: Offset into the destination file. By default is 0. 
  -length <number>: How many bytes of the input should be written. If not
    specified, the whole input will be written into the destination.

burn-vbr <input>: Writes <input> file to the boot record of a chosen partition of a disk file.
  -to <disk>: Destination disk
  -partition <number>: Index of the partition desired. Use "devtk partitions" to view the partitions
    in a disk file.
  -srcOff <number>: Specify a offset into the input file. Default is 0.
  -length <number>: Limit the burned input size to a specific length. If no length was specified,
    the whole file will be burned.

burn-reserved-sectors <input>: Writes <input> to the reserved sectors of a partition in a disk file.
  -to <disk>: Destination disk
  -partition <number>: Index of the partition desired. Use "devtk partitions" to view the partitions
    in a disk file.
  -srcOff <number>: Specify a offset into the input file. Default is 0.
  -length <number>: Limit the burned input size to a specific length. If no length was specified,
    the whole file will be burned.

partitions <disk>: Lists the given partitions in an MBR <disk> file
	
syncdisk <disk>: Invokes a disk synchronization service between a <disk> file and a drop-box
  directory in the user computer.
  -with <path>: Specify the drop-box directory in this machine to be synced with the disk
  -at <path>: Specify a path in the mounted disk to watch

mountdisk <disk>: Mounts a virtual disk. On Windows, this command invokes the
  diskpart system utility and requires elevated privileges. 

unmountdisk <disk>: Unmounts a virtual disk. On Windows, this command invokes the
  diskpart system utility and requires elevated privileges.

help: Prints this help text.

[Examples]
# Overwrites the first 512 bytes of disk.vhd with boot.img
devtk burn boot.img -to disk.vhd -srcOff 0x0 -dstOff 0x0 -length 512

# Mounts the disk file "testdisk.vhd" to synchronize it with a directory "dropfolder". The mounted
location of the disk target directory is "Z:\FILES"
devtk syncdisk "testdisk.vhd" -with "dropfolder\" -at "Z:\FILES\"
